# Water-Flow-Simulation
Projects made for my studies. It was written a while back, so the code is a spaghetti

This project simulates water flow between 3 tanks. It was made with tkinter and pygame (for sound)

###First Page
This page shows general info about waterflow and tanks

###Second Page
Here you can see the 2D simulation and some buttons to start/stop the simulation and 
3 kv sliders (they let you steer % of valve opening)

###Third Page
Here you can see live plots showing current water level in tanks
